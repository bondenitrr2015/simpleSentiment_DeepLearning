# simpleSentiment_DeepLearning
A simple implemnatation of a NLP combined with Deep Learning Neural Networks built in python3 using Google's Tensorflow library.
sentiment_calculator_1.py is built after sentdex's tutorial, here is his channel: www.youtube.com/user/sentdex 

# Input
The input files are pos.txt and neg.txt

# To use
sentiment_calculator_1.py is a script that has functions that convert any sentence into it's vector to feed into the neural network. 
neural_network_1.py is the first neural network (var-500-500-500-var).
